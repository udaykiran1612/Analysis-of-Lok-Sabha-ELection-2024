# Analysis-of-Lok-Sabha-ELection-2024

"This project focuses on extracting and analyzing data from the Election Commission of India's website (https://results.eci.gov.in), specifically on the outcomes of the recent Lok Sabha elections. The analysis will include deriving key insights and producing pie charts that illustrate how votes are distributed across different political parties."

Let's elaborate on the project structure :

1. **Web Scraping of Election Data**: This is the main script responsible for several tasks related to the Lok Sabha election analysis. It likely includes functions or code for data scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and visualization. You might find sections like:
    - Data scraping from online sources (e.g., official election websites).
    - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, transforming data, etc.).
    - Calculating key metrics (vote share, seat distribution, etc.).
    - Creating visualizations (such as bar charts, pie charts, or line plots).
    - Generating insights (party performance, swing states, etc.).

2. **Datasets**: This is CSV file contains the raw election results data. It likely includes columns like 'Constituency,' 'Party,' 'Total Votes,' 'Seats Won,' and other relevant information. The data might be scraped from official election commission websites or other reliable sources.

3. **Data Analysis**: This file serves as a report summarizing the key insights derived from the data analysis. It could include sections like:
    - Overview of the election (total seats, voter turnout, etc.).
    - Party-wise performance (vote share, seat distribution, major wins/losses).
    - Notable constituencies (swing seats, close contests).
    - Trends (regional variations, urban vs. rural, etc.).
Remember to provide detailed comments within your code to explain each step and make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
